## About me 

- A Ph.D. candidate in natural sciences at Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ)
- Based in Leipzig, Germany
- Research focus: I use advanced mass spectrometry and omics approaches to build a data-driven structural understanding of the biogeochemistry of dissolved organic matter

### I'm passionate about

- Storytelling with data
- Reproducible workflows
- Advanced statistical modeling
- Interdisciplinary collaboration

## What I'm Currently Working On

**Research Project**: Investigating ecological differences across spatial gradients using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data. My work focuses on preprocessing, feature extraction, and multivariate statistical analysis to understand chemical variation in ecological systems.

**Personal Project**: Designing a full data visualization course that covers theory and practice using Python and R. The course emphasizes storytelling, effective chart design, and hands-on exercises.
